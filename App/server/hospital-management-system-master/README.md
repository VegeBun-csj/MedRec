# hospital-management-system
A college project using "MySQL" as DBMS. To use this, first you have to create the database using the sql codes inside the 'SQL' folder and then run the app.js using the command- node app.js. To create new users, you need to log in to the system using already created staff account- username: fahim and password: 123456.

It only supports creating new patient, doctor or nurse; but creating new staff is not possible within the current version of the project.
